# Metacrafters-Solidity-Project
This is my project of metacrafters in solidity language.It consists of a smart contract named MyToken.
MyToken is a simple Solidity smart contract that implements a basic token system on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract allows for the minting and burning of tokens, as well as tracking the balances of different addresses.

Features
Token Details: Stores the token name, abbreviation, and total supply.
Balances Mapping: Keeps track of each address's token balance.
Mint Function: Increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address.
Burn Function: Decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, with a check to ensure the address has sufficient balance to burn the specified amount.
